## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Visit https://mikah-mathews.github.io/
* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the top level of the directory.
* Open the index.html file in your browser.

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the top level of the directory in your terminal.
* Run "$ npm install"
* Run "$ npm run build" to build the project.
* Run "$ npm run start" to open the dev server. Or you can open a VS Code live server on the "index.html" file in the "dist" folder.
* Run "$ npm test" to run Jest tests.

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
